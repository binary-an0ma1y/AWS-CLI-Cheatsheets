# Contributing - AWS-CLI-Cheatsheets

Thank you for considering to contribute!

## Key points to note:

- **Basic commands**: Contributions should focus on simple AWS CLI commands that are useful for beginners.Avoid advanced commands or features that might be overwhelming.
- **Crisp yet clear explanations**: Each command should have a brief and clear explanation of what it does.
- **Concise cheatsheets**: List only the minimum commands essential for each service/cheatsheet to ensure they remain "beginner-friendly-cheatsheets" and do not appear like extensive documentation.
